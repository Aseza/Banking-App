<h1>WebService App :<h1/>

#### IMPORTANT ####

I have created this application in the timeline of 10-12 days, working on my own, Solo, to demonstrate the use of WebServices with SOAP protocol to create, update, and check if a client exist along with his account and all his informations in the "Temenos T24" Environment (Core Banking Software).

#### How to Make The App Work ####

Nothing really, make sure you have a servlet/jsp container aka a server like TomCat, import files and run the application, dependencies are shipped already. please note that you will get an error while trying to run the app because there is no access to the local network where T24 Environment exists, however, the source-code will give you an idea of the whole process, and the User/Pass is : Abdel/123
<br/><h4>ðŸ”´ a small document has been attached to show a demo of the app named Demo.PDF ðŸ”´</h4>

#### GOAL ####
The Goal of the app was to showcase the use of SOAP based webservices and how to consume them, the app uses JAXB to transform/Map the XSD schema file in the WSDL file to Java Classes, then use those classes to perform all operations, and JAXB reverses the operation to send Requests and get Responses from the webservice.
